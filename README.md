# mv-testing-practice 👨‍💻

### This repo is an exercise in which we will write a few practical tests for JavaScript functions using the [`Jest`](https://jestjs.io/) library.
- We have to make sure we follow the [AAA pattern](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices#-%EF%B8%8F-12-structure-tests-by-the-aaa-pattern) to make our tests easier for other developers to read and understand.
- You will also try to use the TDD approach in practice.

## Learning objectives
- Write unit tests for a JavaScript app.
- Use AAA pattern for unit tests.
- Explain why testing code is important.
